## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can set up and use Jobs-API, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Node.js and npm: Download and install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- MongoDB: Install MongoDB and ensure it's running. You can download it from [mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com/).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SaifLotfi/Jobs-API.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Jobs-API
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root:

   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```

2. Configure the `.env` file with your environment-specific settings. You can use the provided `.env.example` as a template.

### Running the Server

To start the API server, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The API will be accessible locally at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

### Authentication

Jobs-API uses token-based authentication. To access protected endpoints, users need to obtain an authentication token. Here's how it works:

- **Sign Up**: Users can create a new account by sending a `POST` request to `/api/auth/signup`.

- **Log In**: After signing up, users can log in by sending a `POST` request to `/api/auth/login`. They will receive an authentication token in response.

- **Authorization**: To access protected endpoints, include the obtained token in the `Authorization` header of your requests.

### API Endpoints

Jobs-API provides a variety of endpoints to manage job listings. Some of the main API endpoints include:

- `GET /api/jobs`: Retrieve a list of job listings.
- `GET /api/jobs/:id`: Retrieve a specific job listing by ID.
- `POST /api/jobs`: Create a new job listing (requires authentication).
- `PUT /api/jobs/:id`: Update a job listing (requires authentication).
- `DELETE /api/jobs/:id`: Delete a job listing (requires authentication).

For a complete list of available endpoints and their usage, please refer to the API documentation or the code.
